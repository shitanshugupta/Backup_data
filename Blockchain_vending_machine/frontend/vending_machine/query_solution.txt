//Question  window.ethereum and this.provider
// Answer MetaMask injects a global API into websites visited by its users 
//at window.ethereum (Also available at window.web3.currentProvider for legacy reasons). 
//This API allows websites to request user login, load data from blockchains the user has a connection to,
// and suggest the user sign messages and transactions. You can use this API to detect the user of a web3 browser.
